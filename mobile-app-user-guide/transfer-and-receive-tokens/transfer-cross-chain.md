{% hint style="info" %}
The above display applies when you start the action from the "All accounts" mode.&#x20;

If you start from a single-account mode, the wallet would automatically fill in the "from account" section with the address of the account you are currently in. You would not have to manually select a sending account.&#x20;

To see if you are in the "All accounts" mode or a single-account mode, please look at the account name on top of the home screen:
