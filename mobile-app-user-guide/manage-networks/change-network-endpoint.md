# Change network endpoint

## If you want to change endpoint / provider

In some cases, the wallet might appear slow or fail to settle transactions. A possible cause is that the endpoint / provider fails to respond. \
Users can manually change provider with SubWallet.&#x20;

**Step 1**: Open the network list. Please follow the [instruction](turn-on-turn-off-your-network.md) above to get to the network list.\
Please click the setting icon on the top right corner.
