**Step 3**: Set up an account name and a password for your new account. Then click "Import account".

This password would be crucial, as we would ask you to provide password for every transaction. \

Please note that SubWallet is non-custodial, so you would be the only person who know your password; we cannot help you restore or change password. Please make sure that your password is well-kept.
