# Import by secret phrase

**Step 1**: After following the steps to arrive at the [**Add account**](../create-a-new-account/if-you-already-have-an-account-with-subwallet.md) section, please choose the **Import by secret phrase** option.

**Step 2**: Choose the type of account you want to import.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that one secret phrase can derive both EVM and Substrate accounts, but currently we are not allowing them to be imported at once.&#x20;

\
If you have assets on both EVM chains and Substrate chains that associate with the same secret phrase, please import them twice and choose a different type of account each time.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Step 4**: Name your account and set up a password.\
This password would be crucial, as we would ask you to provide password for every transaction. \
\
Please note that SubWallet is non-custodial, so you would be the only person who know your password; we cannot help you restore or change password. Please make sure that your password is well-kept.
