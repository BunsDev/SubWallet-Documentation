{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that one of the accounts you are managing with SubWallet must be the owner of the NFT. If you import an NFT you do not own (even though you know the network and the contract address), or if you are not managing the NFT owner account with SubWallet, the NFT would not appear in SubWallet.&#x20;
