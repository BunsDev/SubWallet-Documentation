# If you are new to SubWallet

**Step 1**: Once your mobile app is successfully installed, you can open it directly from your phone to start using.&#x20;

You can create a totally new account with SubWallet or import your existing accounts from other wallets and manage them in SubWallet.

Please note that while you can start using the app right away with Android devices, with iOS devices, we would have to ask you some additional questions:

**Step 3**: Please choose the type of account you want to create. \
The difference between Substrate and EVM account is the kind of chains they manage. Assets on Substrate native chains- such as Polkadot, Kusama... would be managed with Substrate account. Assets on EVM chains like Moonbeam, Moonriver...would be managed with EVM account.&#x20;

**Step 4**: Remember your secret phrase, store them in a safe place and never share them with anyone. Please note that if someone has your secret phrase, they would have total control of your account.&#x20;

**Step 6**: Name your wallet and create a password\
This password would be crucial, as we would ask you to provide password for every transaction. \
\
Please note that SubWallet is non-custodial, so you would be the only person who know your password; we cannot help you restore or change password. Please make sure that your password is well-kept.
