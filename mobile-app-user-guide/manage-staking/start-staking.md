**Step 4**: Select a collator. \
The wallet displays the number of people participating in staking for a particular collator, and the **annualized** percentage yield (APY) on staking for such collator. We suggest you choose collators that are (i) not "overcrowded" and (ii) report a significantly high annual return.
