{% endembed %}

For now, there are 2 ways to create new and 4 ways to import your Substrate (Polkadot) accounts and Ethereum accounts on SubWallet. Also, the security of your assets will be enhanced with 3 ways to connect with cold wallets to SubWallet including [Ledger device](broken-reference), [Keystone device](broken-reference), and [Polkadot Vault](broken-reference) (previously Parity Signer). Your privacy and security are our priority.
