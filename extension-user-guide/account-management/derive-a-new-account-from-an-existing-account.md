Your new account would be automatically created and added to the account list.&#x20;

You might want to change the account name. Please follow this [guide](switch-between-accounts-and-change-account-name.md).

You could also derrive a new account from the details section of a particular account. In this case you would not have to go through Step 3 in the above instruction.&#x20;

From Step 2, if you choose the configuration button (the pencil icon next to a particular account), you would be directed to an account details section. You could then choose the Derive account option in this section.&#x20;
