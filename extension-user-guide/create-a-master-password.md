# Create a master password

At the start of your journey with us, we always ask you to create a master password (such as when you [create a new account](broken-reference) or [import an existing account](broken-reference)).&#x20;

If you have already used the beta version of SubWallet before and are migrating to the new version, we would ask you to create and [apply master password](broken-reference) to your existing accounts. Please read the corresponding guide to see if it correctly describes your situation.

Once applied, you can also [change your master password](broken-reference) if you so wish. Please note that you would need your current master password to confirm the change.&#x20;

Last but not least, the master password would allow you to [lock and unlock your wallet](broken-reference) if you so wish.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order to change password, you would need to remember your old password. This function cannot help you if you forget your password and want to restore it.&#x20;

If you lose your password, you would need to [import the account](broken-reference) again with seedphrase, private key, or QR code, and then set up a new password.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
