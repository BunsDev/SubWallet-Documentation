{% hint style="danger" %}
**WARNING:** DO NOT share your mnemonic seed (secret recovery phrase) or JSON backup file with anyone! SubWallet will never ask for your mnemonic seed (secret recovery phrase) or JSON  file, even in a customer support scenario. You can not change or edit your mnemonic seed (secret recovery phrase).
{% endhint %}

Hit the vertical ellipsis icon on the top right corner right below the favicon icon, then choose **Export Account**. Key in your password and choose the   desired format for your backup file. You can choose between private key, QR-code or JSON file. \
