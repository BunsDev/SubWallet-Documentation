# Select Custom Networks

## In a newly installed SubWallet

First **** [create-an-account](create-an-account/ "mention") or [import-and-restore-an-account](import-and-restore-an-account/ "mention"), then the Network Selection screen will pop up. Search or scroll down to select the network(s) that you need to use, then hit **Confirm**. You will see all your selected networks when pressing the drop-down menu on the top. Apart from the four relay chains (Polkadot, Kusama, Westend Testnet & Rococo Testnet), all other networks are arranged in alphabetical order.
