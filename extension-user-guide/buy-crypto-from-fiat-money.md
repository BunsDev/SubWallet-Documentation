# Buy crypto from fiat money

**Step 1**: Open the wallet and choose the "Receive" button. You would see two options. Choose "Buy crypto from fiat". Please make sure that you are not in the "All accounts" mode.&#x20;

**Step 2**: Choose the network associates with the token you want to buy. Please note that most on-ramp service providers only work with main tokens of the network. In this case, if you choose Polkadot Relay Chain, the token you would be able to buy is DOT.&#x20;

**Step 3**: Choose service provider. We are currently working with Transak, MoonPay and Onramper.&#x20;

However, not every token/network is supported. If you interact with the screen and find the selection of service provider muted, it means we are currently not supporting on-ramp buying for your selected network.

**Step 4**: The wallet would redirect you to the service provider's website. Please continue your transaction there.
