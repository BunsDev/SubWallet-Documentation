**Step 4**: Enter provider URL and click "Save".

SubWallet would automatically detect the chain name, token name (symbol) and chain type.&#x20;

If you want to input more information such as price ID, block explorer and crowdloan URL, you're free to do so.&#x20;

In this example, we are importing a chain named "Metaverse Dev". The chain is a Substrate chain with the token symbol named "NUUM".&#x20;

Once your chain has been imported, you would be directed to the Manage Chains section. If you perform a search for your newly imported chain, it shall be found.&#x20;
