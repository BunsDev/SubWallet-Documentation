# Start staking

## If you want to stake in a nomination pool (Pooled staking)

{% hint style="info" %}
SubWallet is currently supporting pooled staking for Substrate blockchains.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Step 1**: Open SubWallet and choose the Staking tab. Then click the "+" icon on the upper right corner to start staking.&#x20;

**Step 2**: Choose the "Pool" tab in the "Add to Bond" screen and enter the staking information.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are in all-accounts mode like the current example, you would need to choose the staking account.&#x20;

If you have already been in a single account, you would not have to select account. Your Step 2 would be as the following image:

{% endhint %}

We suggest you pay close attention to the pool you are choosing. When selecting pool, SubWallet support you with the latest record of pool details. Please click the three-dot icon on the right hand side of each pool to see the pool details.

{% hint style="info" %}
You could use the sort function to find the most suitable validator according to your need. Please click the sort icon on the upper right corner and choose your sorting criteria.&#x20;

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
We also identify destroyed/ inactive pool. **We suggest that you always choose an active pool to stake with**.&#x20;

To filter out active pool, click the fader icon on the right hand side of the search validator bar. Then click the checkbox "Active validator".&#x20;

{% endhint %}

An example of a complete input for pooled staking would be like the following image:

Click "Stake" to continue.



**Step 3**: Check the information and confirm your staking request by clicking "Approve".&#x20;

Step 4: Result is in!

You could see your staking transaction in the History tab.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (172) (2).png>)

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (395).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you click "view transaction", the wallet would show you the latest transaction record in your transaction history which corresponds with the extrinsic hash of this action.&#x20;

In this example, the staking request was a failed transaction because we did not stake enough AZERO to also cover the fee.&#x20;

Network fee could be extra small (so it would appear zero in the confirmation screen). Best practice to keep in mind is to always stake slightly above minimum active stake.&#x20;

To get to the transaction history tab, please follow this [guide](../../view-transaction-history.md).
