{% hint style="info" %}
In the above example, we are in "All accounts" mode. If you are already in a single account mode, you would not have to select an account. Your staking request form would be like the following image:

{% endhint %}

Please note that since this is a "stake more" action for a previously performed staking, you might not choose a different validator. If you want to stake for another validator, you would need to start a new staking action.&#x20;

An example of a completed stake more request would be the following:
