# Unstake tokens

**Step 1**: On your Staking screen, hit the **ellipsis icon** next to Staking balance. Choose **Unstake**. This will allow you to unstake from a validator/collator/ but still keep your funds locked.

{% hint style="info" %}
Depending on the network, your unstaked tokens can be withdrawn to your transferrable balance after a certain amount of time (approximately 7 days in Kusama, 14 days in Aleph Zero, 28 days in Polkadot and HydraDX). The clock on the **Withdraw** button shows you how much time is left before you can withdraw your unstaked funds.
