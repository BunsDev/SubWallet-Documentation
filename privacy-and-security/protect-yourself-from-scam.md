# Protect Yourself from Scam

**SubWallet is installed on your computer; all data is stored on your computer as well. We do not collect and manage any user data, so you need to ensure safety with these steps:**

* Always protect your computer and keep your data secured.&#x20;
* Do not use SubWallet to access untrusted websites. We also support you with [phishing prevention](https://docs.subwallet.app/main/privacy-and-security/security#6.-phishing-prevention).
* Carefully read through all information before granting access to any application.&#x20;
* Do not use SubWallet for high-volume assets. SubWallet aims to become a gateway to access Web3 applications, not a pocket to store money. Rather, you should use Cold Wallets such as Parityâ€™s Parity Signer to secure large assets.&#x20;
* Always double-check before making transactions.&#x20;
* Never share your Private Key or Mnemonic Seed with anyone, even us. SubWallet does not collect any user's confidential information.
