# Introduction

## **What** &#x20;

## Why

**SubWallet** is built on top of Polkadot {.js} and focuses on improving user experience—that is, we strive to make it easier for users to access and interact with Web3 applications that run on the Substrate Framework. In other words, we base SubWallet on Polkadot {.js}'s security backbone while improving all of its current drawbacks, including but not limited to:

* Cumbersome infrastructure
* Complicated user interface&#x20;
* High latency &#x20;

This does not mean that we deny the contribution of Polkadot {.js}. It sets a crucial stepping stone for developers and plays a vital role for the Dotsama ecosystem owing to its decentralization. Since there are too many blockchains and projects on the ecosystem that need to be managed, keeping track is immensely challenging for developers without a massive application like Polkadot {.js}. However, end-users don't need this; they need something faster and more user-friendly. That's why **SubWallet** was born.

In the long run, we still believe that in the ecosystem, Polkadot JS is a pivotal platform application for developers. Our mission is to harness its power and bring it closer to the wider community through user-friendly applications like **SubWallet**.&#x20;

## How

Below are our main features, or how have we improved from Polkadot {.js}:&#x20;

* Monitor multi-chain assets on extension window
* Send and receive assets with a few simple taps
* Grant access and verify transactions to Web3
* Manage and transfer NFT assets
* Manage portfolio
* And many more soon
