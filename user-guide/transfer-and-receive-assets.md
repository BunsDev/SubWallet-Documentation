**Step 2:** Type your password to unlock and send assets. Before clicking **Make Transfer** to proceed with the transaction, it is always better to _double-check_ the recipient address and the amount you are sending.

**Step 3:** After your fund has been successfully transferred, the transaction log is available in your wallet. You can also check your transaction on SubScan if you wish to.

## **Receive**

**Step 1:** Find your SubWallet address (if you don't know yet) by clicking the **Receive** icon. The long sequence containing both numbers and letters is your wallet address.
