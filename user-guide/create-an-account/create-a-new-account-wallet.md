**Step 2:** The system will automatically generate a 12-word mnemonic seed for your account. Please note that this is the key to your wallet. If someone has the key, they have _<mark style="color:red;">complete access</mark>_ to it. Make sure that you _<mark style="color:red;">backup</mark>_ and keep your mnemonic seed in a _<mark style="color:red;">secure location</mark>_**.** Choose the first type of account, then tick **I have saved my mnemonic seed safely** before hitting **Next step**.&#x20;
