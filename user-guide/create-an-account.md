**Step 2:** The system will automatically generate a 12-word mnemonic seed for your account. Please note that this is the key to your wallet. If someone has the key, they have _<mark style="color:red;">complete access</mark>_ to it. Make sure that you _<mark style="color:red;">backup</mark>_ and keep your mnemonic seed in a _<mark style="color:red;">secure location</mark>_**.** First choose the type of account you want to create (normal or EVM), then tick **I have saved my mnemonic seed safely** before hitting **Next step**.&#x20;

**WARNING:** DO NOT share your mnemonic seed (secret recovery phrase) with anyone! SubWallet will never ask for your mnemonic seed (secret recovery phrase), even in a customer support scenario. You can not change or edit your mnemonic seed (secret recovery phrase).
{% endhint %}

**Step 3:** Set a password. You can change the name of your account later (read on for instructions). Then click on **Add the account with the generated seed**. Your account is ready to go.
